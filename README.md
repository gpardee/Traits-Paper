# Traits-Paper
this repository contains the data used for the paper titled "Life history traits predict responses of wild bees to climate change". The folder titled "final matrices" contains the 3 matrices used in the 4th corner analysis: 1 abundance matrix, 1 trait matrix, and 1 site matrix. The abundance matrix is the number of bees caught per hour across each site and year. The traits matrix lists the trait information for each species. The site matrix lists the environmental information for each site and year. 

This repository also cantains the R codes we ran for each trait we were interested in examining.
